This file describes the storage format of arch_definitions.h

Storage format:
/* [ARCH_SPECIFIC_DEFINE],[ACONST1,ACONST2] */
ARCH_DESC_DEFINE(ARCH_NAME,ARCH_ABI,PASS({COMPAT_PERS1,COMPAT_PERS2,...}),\
PASS({ALIAS1,ALIAS2,...}))

ARCH_SPECIFIC_DEFINE:
One syscallent.h header can contain several set of system calls for each
compatible mode. And specific set can be switched by passing particular
definition.
So ARCH_SPECIFIC_DEFINE allows to forward a given definition, where
!ARCH_SPECIFIC_DEFINE forwards undefined.
If it is not required, left empty.

ACONST1,ACONST2:
It could be used to store architecture specific constants and pass them to code.
If is is not required each one must be set to zero.

ARCH_NAME:
The main name of architecture will be used to generate the personality
constants.
The personality constant is equal to ARCH_+\$ARCH_ABI+_+\$ARCH_NAME.

ARCH_ABI:
Application binary interface for a given architecture, i.e. 32bit, 64bit, oabi,
eabi, o32 etc.

COMPAT_PERS1,COMPAT_PERS2,...:
Compatible mode for a given architecture. It should be one of personality
constants.
If is is not required, left empty.

ALIAS1,ALIAS2,...:
Other name of the same architecture, like x86 and i386. At least one alias
must to be set as it shows the name of architecture while printing.
If current ARCH_NAME is just the compatible ABI mode, left empty.
